          <b>Insideout</>
            is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar
            Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film was
            directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronnie del Carmen, with a
            screenplay written by Docter, Meg LeFauve, and Josh Cooley, adapted from a
            story by Docter and del Carmen. The film is set in the mind of a young
            girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy
            Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader),
            and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as she and her
            parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) adjust to their new surroundings
            after moving from Minnesota to San Francisco.

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>
          Within the mind of an American girl named Riley are the basic emotions who
          control her actions—Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Her
          experiences become memories, stored as colored orbs, which are sent into
          long-term memory each night. Her five most important "core memories" power
          aspects of her personality which take the form of floating islands. Joy
          acts as the leader, and she and the rest of the emotions try to limit
          Sadness's influence.
